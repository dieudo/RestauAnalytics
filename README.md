**Introduction**
NYC restaurants are regularly inspected and assigned violation scores. This App aims to capture restaurants likely to fall into bad grades in the next inspection cycle.

Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and a Baseline of using the last value are all considered in the modeling process.

The tool could be used by NYC food inspectors or stakeholders to prioritize their tasks.
